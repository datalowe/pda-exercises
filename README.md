# Python for Data Analysis, chapter 6, exercises
This is a repo for a few exercises to go with the ['Python for Data Analysis'](https://wesmckinney.com/pages/book.html) book, chapter 6. They were created for the PyLadies PfDA study group. You are free to share the exercises, and if you do, then please spread the word about PyLadies.

The exercises are all in the Jupyter notebook ('pda_exercises_6.ipynb'). Do try to solve them yourself before looking at the solutions (click the collapsed fields to reveal them). The one exception is if you haven't used API's at all before. In that case, it's probably more helpful to look at the solution of Exercise 4 right away, and then try to create your own API requests by modifying the solution code.
